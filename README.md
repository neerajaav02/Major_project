Skin Disease Prediction System

This project is a comprehensive system designed to detect and classify various skin diseases using deep learning. It includes web, database, and machine learning components.

Project Modules

 1. Major Project (Core Logic)
- Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for skin disease classification.
- Dataset includes 4,203 images across 24 skin disease categories, including 7 types of skin cancer.
- Applied data preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation techniques.
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

 2. Major Project - Web
- Built a user-friendly web interface for doctors and admin panel.
- Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Flask .
- Users can upload images and view predictions instantly.
- Admin and doctor dashboards for patient record management and report generation.

 3. Major Project - Database
- Designed and integrated a backend database (e.g., MySQL or Firebase).
- Stores user details, image prediction history, doctor notes, and patient feedback.

Features
- Predicts disease from uploaded skin images.
- Admin & Doctor panel for record management.
- Integrated ML model for real-time predictions.
- Cross-platform functionality (Web + Android).

 Tech Stack
